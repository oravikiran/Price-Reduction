# Products Restful Webservice

This is a Java / Maven / Spring Boot (version 2.5.0) application that creates a restful webservice to request dresses that have a price reduction from the below API,
[https://api.johnlewis.com/search/api/rest/v2/catalog/products/search/keyword?q=dresses](https://api.johnlewis.com/search/api/rest/v2/catalog/products/search/keyword?q=dresses&key=AIzaSyDD_6O5gUgC4tRW5f9kxC0_76XRC8W7_mI)

## About the Service

The array of products processed from the [provided api url](https://api.johnlewis.com/search/api/rest/v2/catalog/products/search/keyword?q=dresses&key=AIzaSyDD_6O5gUgC4tRW5f9kxC0_76XRC8W7_mI) should only contain products with a price reduction and should be sorted to show the highest price reduction first. 
Price reduction is calculated using price.was - price.now.

**NOTE:**
_If there is invalid data in the [used](https://api.johnlewis.com/search/api/rest/v2/catalog/products/search/keyword?q=dresses&key=AIzaSyDD_6O5gUgC4tRW5f9kxC0_76XRC8W7_mI) api response then assuming a value of zero rather than throwing exceptions or creating complex error logging._

Each products in the returned array should contain:

`productId <String>`
`title <String>`
`An array of colorSwatches`. Each element should contain:
-  `color<String>`
- `rgbColor<String>` which is an RGB representation of the basicColor in a six digit
hexadecimal format, e.g. “F0A1C2”.
- `skuid<String>`
- `nowPrice<String>` which is the price.now represented as a string, including the currency, e.g.
“£1.75”. For values that are integer, if they are less £10 return a decimal price, otherwise show an
integer price, e.g. “£2.00” or “£10”.

`priceLabel<String>`. An optional query parm called labelType can be set to any of:
1. **ShowWasNow** - in which case return a string saying “Was £x.xx, now £y.yyy”.
2. **ShowWasThenNow** - in which case return a string saying “Was £x.xx, then £y.yy, now
£z.zzz”. If the original price.then2 is not empty use that for the “then” price otherwise use
the then1 price. If the then1 price is also empty then don’t show the “then” price.
3. **ShowPercDscount** - in which case return “x% off - now £y.yy”.
If the query parm is not set default to use ShowWasNow format.
In all cases use the price formatting as described for nowPrice
